Whether you’re a seasoned plant enthusiast or a beginner, rubber plants are a great choice for adding greenery to your indoor space.</p><p> One of the key factors in rubber plant care is finding the right spot for your plant.

Occasional pruning can help maintain their shape and promote bushier growth. You can also propagate new plants from stem cuttings, making rubber plants an economical option for plant enthusiasts. Simply cut a healthy stem below a leaf node, remove the lower leaves, and place the cutting in a jar of water. Once roots form, transfer the cutting to a pot with well-draining soil.</p><p> With their low maintenance requirements and numerous benefits, rubber plants are a fantastic choice for any indoor plant lover. Not only do they add beauty to your space with their glossy leaves and tropical vibes, but they also help purify the air, enhance concentration, and provide stress relief.
